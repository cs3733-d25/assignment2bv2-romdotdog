            <td>Duns Scotus</td>
            <td>1266-1308</td>
            <td>Introduced <i>univocity of being</i> and <i>formal distinction</i> wrt. ontology, without using Aristotelian/Thomist analogy. Foundational thinker for unhierarchical metaphysics.</td>

            <td>Baruch Spinoza</td>
            <td>1632-1677</td>
            <td>Transformed univocity into <i>expressive immanence</i>. Substance, attributes, and modes are all univocal, and difference is internal, not hierarchical. Massive leap towards anti-Hegelian ontology.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Friedrich Nietzsche</td>
            <td>1844-1900</td>
            <td>Repudiates identity through the view that <i>difference returns eternally</i>. Will to power and eternal return as engines of becoming, not static being. Turns univocity into force and affirmation.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Gilles Deleuze</td>
            <td>1925-1995</td>
            <td>Synthesizes the lineage: univocity is <i>pure difference</i>. Substance is said of the modes and only the modes. Formal distinction becomes ontological genesis. Down with the dialectic!</td>
