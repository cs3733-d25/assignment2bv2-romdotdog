        <p>I've been reading continental philosophy since senior year of high school. I first tried to read Derrida with surprising success, but I found that my true interest is in schizoanalysis and Marxian economics. I use the former to continuously assess and change my mental state and well-being, and I use the latter to gain a greater understanding of how the world imposes on and affects me and others.</p>
        <p>Here are some philosophers I like:</p>
